# AI Generated Skybox

This scene uses a Blockade Gamesâ€™ [text to skybox tool](http://skybox.blockadelabs.com) to build a skybox around the player. Note that this requires a pretty large scene area, ideally in a Decentraland World.

The scene maps the texture generated by this tool to a large cube, which is attached to the player's position, and moves together with the player to maintain the illusion of the background being always out of reach.
